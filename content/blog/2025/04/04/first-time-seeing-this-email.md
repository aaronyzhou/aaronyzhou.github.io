I've been on the job search and this is the first time I've seen an email saying that they are still sifting through resumes. Everyone knows the recruitment process is under a lot of pressure lately. There are tools that are making it trivial to mass apply to a bunch of jobs and as a result every job posting has hundreds of low quality candidates. 

It's really frustrating applying to a bunch of jobs and not hearing back so I'm glad that companies are sending status updates.
