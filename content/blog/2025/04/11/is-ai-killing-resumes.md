title = 'Is AI Killing Resumes?'

Right now there are a bunch of tools that can rewrite your resume to match a job description. On the other side, there are also AI tools that pick out keywords from resumes. The entire process feels very silly. 

Theoretically, this type of problem should be solveable by some single centralized entity liked LinkedIn that acts as a trusted authority but this could lead to a different set of problems. For example your account can be hacked and the hacker can delete all your connections.

I've seen a bunch of "recruitment agencies" that also try and operate at scale, but the incentives don't quite align for them to be useful to either job seekers and companies. These companies earn a commission per placement and tend to focus on quantity over quality.
