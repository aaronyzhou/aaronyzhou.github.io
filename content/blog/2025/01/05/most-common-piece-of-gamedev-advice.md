The most common gamedev advice I hear is to start small and build some really easy projects like Snake before tackling your dream game. 

There's merit to this advice of course; you won't be able to finish a large game if you can't finish a small game.

The problem, however, is the implication that at some point, if you've done enough small projects, you'll be ready to take on a big project. This simply isn't the case. Working on a large project has completely different challenges than small projects. This is because the complexity of a codebase scales quadratically with the number of lines, not linearly. Each line can interact with every other line.

Fortunately, you don't have to write a bunch of code to gain experience in working with a large codebase. Working a year as a professional software developer in a reasonable sized company is usually sufficient. If you don't plan on coding professionally and just want to gamedev for fun I recommend finding a decently sized open source game like [Wesnoth](https://github.com/wesnoth/wesnoth) and trying to make some changes. You don't have to contribute anything meaningful, just build your capacity to mentally track multiple pieces of code. I know it might not be "fun" doing this exercise but I guarantee it'll greatly accelerate your ability to manage large projects.
