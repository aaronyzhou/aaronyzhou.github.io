Back when I was in college, about ten years ago, a recruiter posted a job description on the college job board that included the line 'Java, also known as javascript'. It got shared to the CS facebook group and we all made fun of it because Java and Javascript are two completely different programming languages.

Today a recruiter asked me if I could code in java based on the fact that I have javascript on my resume. 

Java and Javascript both refuse to die so I expect to see this mistake continue to pop up.
