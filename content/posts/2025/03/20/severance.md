Severance had some cool ideas which I would have liked to see the show explore more rather than devolve into personal drama. A big factor which limits the show is that the working environment the innies reside is obviously terrible. Though perhaps it would be completely uninteresting if the innies had a normal work life.

The concept of severance ties into the idea of work-life balance which the show doesn't address at all.
